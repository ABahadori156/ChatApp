 //To look for data, we need to look at the collection of all messages that the message referenced
 //And we have to observe any event that occurs at this location - Events can be like when a child location is added, removed, changed
 //This data is retrieved anytime an event occurs
 
 //For pulling a new message, we should pull the new child that is added to the message location (FIRDataEventType.childAdded)
 //Due to the .childAdded event, each message will be printed 1 by 1, and the snapshot value is not a dictionary anymore
 messageRef.observe(FIRDataEventType.childAdded) { (snapshot: FIRDataSnapshot) in
 print("Snapshot at messages: \(snapshot.value!)")
 //.value is 'optional AnyObject' because there can be no data in the database to observe sometimes, and there are different types of data so AnyObject is used
 //Now to extract the data information we want, we have to convert the Snapshot value to the type we expect
 //            if let dict = snapshot.value as? NSDictionary {
 //                print("Extracted data from Snapshot: \(dict)")
 //            }
